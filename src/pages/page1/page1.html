  <h3>What is Cystic Fibrosis</h3>

  <p>Cystic fibrosis is a progressive, genetic disease that causes persistent lung infections and limits the ability to breathe over time.</p>
  <p>In people with CF, a defective gene causes a thick, buildup of mucus in the lungs, pancreas and other organs. In the lungs, the mucus clogs the airways and traps bacteria leading to infections, extensive lung damage and eventually, respiratory failure. In the pancreas, the mucus prevents the release of digestive enzymes that allow the body to break down food and absorb vital nutrients.</p>

  <h4>Symptoms of CF</h4>
  <p>People with CF can have a variety of symptoms, including</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Very Salty-tasting skin</li>
    <li>Persistent coughing, at times with phlegm</li>
    <li>Frequent lung infections including pheumonia or bronchitis</li>
    <li>Wheezing or shortness of breath</li>
    <li>Poor growth or weight gain in spite of a good appetite</li>
    <li>Frequent greasy, bulky stools or difficulty with bowel movements</li>
  </ul>
