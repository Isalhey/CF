  <h3>Treatment Plan</h3>

  <p>Treatment plans help people with cystic fibrosis maintain their health so they can live longer, more fulfilling lives. Although every treatment plan is unique, comprehensive CF treatment plans usually include quarterly visits to a CF care center and the following components: airway clearance techniques; oral, inhaled and nebulized medications; nutrition therapies; and a fitness plan.</p>

  <h4>You Are in Charge</h4>
  <p>Every person with CF has a different treatment plan. Yours is unique to your specific health needs, age, lifestyle, goals and medical test results. Your care team will partner with you so you can maintain good health as long as possible and achieve your personal goals.</p>
  <p>There is a lot you can do to successfully manage your health. With your input, your care team can work with you to develop your treatment plan. From there, you decide how to manage it every day. Successful management means developing a routine for taking your medications, clearing your airways, avoiding germs, eating a high-calorie diet and following a fitness plan. That puts you in control of your health.</p>

  <h4>One Step at a Time</h4>
  <p>Small changes can make a big difference, so take it one step at a time. Follow your treatment plan consistently until it becomes part of your daily routine. You will likely feel more energetic. You may have fewer hospitalizations and exacerbations (worsening of your symptoms) and, in many cases, have better lung function - all of which can contribute to a longer and better life.</p>
  <p>This is your treatment plan, so you can develop a schedule that works best for you. Managing your treatment plan requires you to be organized and committed in order to do it successfully. When creating your treatment routine, consider the following:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Create a routine for airway clearance and breathing treatments. Enter it on your calendar as an appointment so you won't forget when scheduling other events.</li>
    <li>Review your calendar for the upcoming week so you can adjust your treatment schedule if you need to.</li>
    <li>Create reminders on your computer or mobile device for airway clearance and when it's time to take medications, including digestive enzymes.</li>
    <li>Keep a running list of challenges you're facing in sticking with your daily treatment plan and talk with your care team about them at your next visit.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Making your health a priority and finding creative ways to fit your treatments into your day will help you to successfully manage your CF so that you can reach your personal goals.</p>
