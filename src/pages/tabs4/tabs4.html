  <h3>Medications</h3>

  <p>Your CF doctor may prescribe many medications to help keep your lungs clear, prevent or fight infections and, for some people, help correct the underlying cause of the disease. Medications that people need to fight infections for a long time may require additional devices, such as PICCs and ports.</p>

  <h4>Antibiotics</h4>
  <p>Antibiotics fight infections caused by bacteria. They should not be used to treat infections caused by viruses (such as the flu) or types of fungi, which include yeasts and molds.</p>

  <h4>Mucus Thinners</h4>
  <p>Mucus thinners, such as mucolytics, are inhaled medications that help thin the mucus in the airways so you can cough it out of your lungs more easily. The two main types of mucus thinners are hypertonic saline and dornase alfa (PulmozymeÂ®).</p>

  <h4>Nebulizer Care at Home</h4>
  <p>It is important to always clean and disinfect your nebulizer because you can breathe in germs through your nebulizer and risk developing a lung infection.</p>

  <h4>CFTR Modulator Therapies</h4>
  <p>CFTR (cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator) modulator therapies are designed to correct the function of the defective protein made by the CF gene. Because different mutations cause different defects in the protein, the medications that have been developed so far are effective only in people with specific mutations.</p>
