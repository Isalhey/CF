  <h3>Airway Clearence</h3>

  <p>Airway clearance techniques (ACTs) loosen thick, sticky mucus so it can be cleared from your lungs by coughing or huffing. Clearing the airways may help decrease lung infections and improve lung function.</p>

  <h4>Basics of Lungs care</h4>
  <p>Breathing problems (also called respiratory or pulmonary problems) affect the lungs and the airways and are the most serious problems associated with CF. The severity of respiratory problems differs for each person. For most people with CF, lung disease affects how well they do and how long they live. Many treatments are available to keep the lungs as healthy as possible.</p>

  <h4>Airway Clearance Techniques (ACTs)</h4>
  <p>There are different ways to clear your airways. Most are easy to do. Infants and toddlers will need help from a parent or caregiver. Older kids and adults can choose ACTs that they can do on their own.</p>
  <p>All ACTs involve coughing or huffing. Many of them use percussion (clapping) or vibration to loosen mucus from airway walls.</p>
  <p>ACTs are often used with other treatments, including inhaled bronchodilators, medications that help thin and move the mucus, and antibiotics. Bronchodilators should be inhaled before you start ACTs. This medication helps to widen your airways (bronchi) by relaxing the muscles lining your airway walls. Mucus thinners (sometimes referred to as mucolytics) help thin and then move the mucus out of the airways so it can be coughed out. These medications can be taken through a nebulizer during ACTs. Inhaled antibiotics should be taken after ACTs are finished and the lungs are as clear of mucus as possible. This will allow the medication to reach deeply into the smaller airways to attack bacteria.</p>

  <h4>Coughing and Huffing</h4>
  <p>Coughing is the most basic airway clearance technique (ACT). It can be an involuntary reflex or it can be controlled as a healthy, natural way for the lungs to get rid of mucus. </p>

  <p>Although coughing can help move mucus out of the larger airways, it is not effective for moving mucus out of the smaller ones. This is why coughing should be done with other ACTs, which are more effective at moving mucus up from the smaller airways into the larger ones, where it can be coughed out.</p>

  <p>With CF, you shouldn't try to suppress coughs, or keep yourself from coughing. To avoid spreading germs, you can cough into a tissue, throw it away and then clean your hands with an alcohol-based hand gel. If you don't have a tissue, cough into your inner elbow. If you cough into your hands, wash your hands immediately afterward.</p>

  <h4>Huffing</h4>
  <p>Huffing, also known as huff coughing, is a technique that helps move mucus from the lungs. It should be done in combination with another ACT. It involves taking a breath in, holding it and actively exhaling. Breathing in and holding it enables air to get behind the mucus and separates it from the lung wall so it can be blown out. Huffing is not as forceful as a cough, but it can work better and be less tiring. Huffing is like exhaling onto a mirror or window to steam it up.</p>
  <p>The Huff Coughing Technique:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Sit up straight with chin tilted slightly up and mouth open.</li>
    <li>Take a slow deep breath to fill lungs about three quarters full.</li>
    <li>Hold breath for two or three seconds.</li>
    <li>Exhale forcefully, but slowly, in a continuous exhalation to move mucus from the smaller to the larger airways.</li>
    <li>Repeat this maneuver two more times and then follow with one strong cough to clear mucus from the larger airways.</li>
    <li>Do a cycle of four to five huff coughs as part of your airway clearance.</li>
  </ul>
